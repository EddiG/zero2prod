# Zero To Production meets Axum
It contains code written while reading the book [Zero To Production In Rust](https://www.zero2prod.com/) and applied to the web framework [Axum](https://github.com/tokio-rs/axum).
Please have a look at the [Axum branch](https://github.com/EddiG/zero2prod/tree/axum)
##### Attention! It's not finished yet, most of the work is done up to chapter 5.
